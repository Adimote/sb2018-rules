\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens of
        one -- but only one -- colour, and to return them to one's home zone.
  \item The arena contains twelve tokens: six gold and six silver. The layout
        is detailed in Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. Each token is worth 2
        points. Three of each colour start on an elevated platform in the centre
        of the arena.
  \item At the end of the game, each robot is awarded the sum of the value of
        all tokens entirely within their starting zone. This value is halved
        if there are both gold and silver tokens within that zone.
  \item An additional bonus point is awarded for any movement from the start
        position of a robot.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials at
        least one minute before the start of each match. They will be asked to
        place their robot in the arena, and vacate the arena at least 30 seconds
        before the official start time of the match.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting zones.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $180$ seconds.
  \item At the end of each match, teams must wait for instructions to collect
        their robots or risk disqualification. This is in order to give match
        officials time to record scores.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
