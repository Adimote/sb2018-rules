\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        \specref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens, and to bring
        them to one's scoring zone in addition to removing opponents tokens from
        your zone.
  \item The arena contains 20 tokens. The layout is detailed in
        \specref{spec:arena}. Each token of a matching colour placed in your
        zone is worth 3 points. Each token of a non-matching colour placed in
        your zone is worth -1 points: that is, a non-matching colour will lose
        points.
  \item At the end of the game, each robot is awarded the sum of the value of
        all tokens within their scoring zone (see rule \ruleref{rules:token})
  \item An additional 1 bonus point is awarded if a robot moves out of its
        starting zone.
  \item \label{rules:token}A token is in a scoring zone if, and only if, it
        has three corners in contact with the floor in the zone.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials at
        least one minute before the start of each match.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting zones.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $150$ seconds.
  \item Teams must not touch their robots during matches, except to start their
        robot's movement.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
